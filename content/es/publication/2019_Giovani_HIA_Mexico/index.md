abstract: "Objectives: To estimate avoidable mortality, potential years of life lost and economic costs associated with particulate matter PM2.5 exposure for 2 years (2013 and 2015) in Mexico using two scenarios of reduced concentrations (i.e., mean annual PM2.5 concentration < 12 µg/m3 and mean annual PM2.5 concentration < 10 µg/m3).
Methods: The health impact assessment method was followed. This method consists of: identification of health effects, selection of concentration-response functions, estimation of exposure, quantification of impacts quantification and economic assessment using the willingness to pay and human capital approaches."
